  <h2>Marketing That Advocates for You</h2>
  <p (click)="navigateToAboutMeExpanded()">
    My name is Jessica Epps. I am a Social Media & Marketing Manager. Nine years
    ago, I began working in this space in order to advocate for artists. Each
    day at work, I try to fill my marketing copy with class, wit, and ernest
    inspiration.
